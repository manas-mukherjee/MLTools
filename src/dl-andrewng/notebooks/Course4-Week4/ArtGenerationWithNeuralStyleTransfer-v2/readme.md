** What we should remember **:

- Face verification solves an easier 1:1 matching problem; face recognition addresses a harder 1:K matching problem.
- The triplet loss is an effective loss function for training a neural network to learn an encoding of a face image.
- The same encoding can be used for verification and recognition. Measuring distances between two images' encodings allows you to determine whether they are pictures of the same person.
