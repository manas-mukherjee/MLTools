Diabetes Prediction
===================

This GitHub repo contains the capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree program.
In this project, I've created a supervised ML model that predicts diabetes based on a set of input features.
I explored different classification algorithms like LR, GNB, DT, KNN etc and compared their performances.
Based on the F2-score and recall score, I selected GradientBoost algorithm as the best classifier. I tuned it further to optimize the model's performance.
The final model shows 0.84 as accuracy score, 0.77 as recall score with minimal(11) false negative prediction.

Pre-requisites
--------------

This project was done in Python 3.5 environment with the following python libs:

- Scikit-Learn
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Data
----

This model is built using the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset which is available in the following link.
